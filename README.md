# Stock Prediction

This project is created on python for predicting stock prices using a hybrid model which consists of LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory) & Ensemble EMD (Emperical Mode Decomposition). We have considered the share prices of Netflix Company (span: 2018 to 2022).


## Installation

You can install python on your computer on any of the tools (like VsCode) and run the code through it.

If you don't want to run it on any such applications, then you can use Google Colab.
